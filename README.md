# Portable Air Quality Monitor
Over the past three years, Air Quality has become more and more of a concern for many of us. COVID exposed many buildings having insufficient HVAC units. Unfortunately, portable air quality monitors are unaffordable for the vast majority of people retailing in the $300+ range. We aim to build something that is more affordable, while still being accurate.Â

This repository contains all of our website's infrastructure, as well as the code used for our hardware.
<br>
## Hardware Used
- Raspberry Pi 3b+
- Enviroplus Sensor
- PMS5003 Sensor
- VK162 GPS Module
<br>
To support the testing and development of the Smark Air website, we've set up a temporary web server, complete with a webpage and a database. This infrastructure serves as an ideal environment for experimenting with HTML and PHP code intended for the website. Moreover, we've secured the domain name for Smark Air and configured Amazon LightSail for deploying the website. The administrative aspect is equally well-organized, with administrator accounts established on LightSail to enable our team members to contribute content to the website. The fundamental layout of the website is in place, and we are currently working on implementing user registration features. As we continue to make progress, our vision for Smark Air, a platform that provides valuable air quality information, is rapidly taking shape.

## Sprint 2
We began with a focus on user administration and device management functions, ensuring the seamless handling of user accounts and monitoring device. We documented our processes and procedures, creating a comprehensive reference for future endeavors and troubleshooting. We configured the integration of Lightsail Additionally, we began development of a API to allow the data to be POSTed to our live database in Lightsail, essential for the storage and retrieval of air quality data. A significant milestone was reached as we completed the alpha Raspberry Pi code. To further enrich user experience, we established a dedicated documentation page on our project's website, granting users easy access to user instructions on how to register their device.

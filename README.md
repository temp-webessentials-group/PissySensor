# Project Summary 

The arrival and successful connection of the air quality monitor sensors to the Raspberry Pi marks a significant milestone in our project. Leveraging Python coding, we've efficiently transformed the sensor data into a comprehensible format. At this stage, the Raspberry Pi is actively collecting air quality readings, which are currently being stored locally. Our next step involves the seamless transmission of this data to our database via a post request. In a recent development, we've acquired an additional geolocation sensor, which will further enhance the capabilities of our air quality monitor by allowing it to determine the geographical location of readings. 

To support the testing and development of the Smark Air website, we've set up a temporary web server, complete with a webpage and a database. This infrastructure serves as an ideal environment for experimenting with HTML and PHP code intended for the website. Moreover, we've secured the domain name for Smark Air and configured Amazon LightSail for deploying the website. The administrative aspect is equally well-organized, with administrator accounts established on LightSail to enable our team members to contribute content to the website. The fundamental layout of the website is in place, and we are currently working on implementing user registration features. As we continue to make progress, our vision for Smark Air, a platform that provides valuable air quality information, is rapidly taking shape.

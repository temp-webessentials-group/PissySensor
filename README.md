# Portable Air Quality Monitor
Over the past three years, Air Quality has become more and more of a concern for many of us. COVID exposed many buildings having insufficient HVAC units. Unfortunately, portable air quality monitors are unaffordable for the vast majority of people retailing in the $300+ range. We aim to build something that is more affordable, while still being accurate.Â
